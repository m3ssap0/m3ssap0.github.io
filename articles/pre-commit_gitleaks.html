            <a name="problem-statement"><h2>Problem Statement</h2></a>
            <p>Committing in a repository confidential material like passwords, API secrets, private keys is a <strong>severe security issue</strong> and could have <strong>serious consequences</strong>.</p>
            <p>The nature of version control systems is to track all changes performed over time on a specific code base. For this reason, simply removing the leaked material with a subsequential commit is usually not sufficient: a <strong>malicious actor could access to the history</strong> and retrieve the leaked secret, using it to move laterally in the system.</p>
            <p>There are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#purging-a-file-from-your-repositorys-history" target="_blank">techniques to clean repository history</a> and you can always invalidate a leaked secret, but this could be time consuming and leaks could happen accidentally, without you noticing it.</p>

            <a name="possible-solution"><h2>Possible Solution: Gitleaks + pre-commit</h2></a>
            <p>Luckily for us, there are some tools that can be used to automate leaks detection, blocking a commit operation <em>before</em> the leak happens.</p>
            <p>The first tool that can help is <strong><em>Gitleaks</em></strong> (<a href="https://gitleaks.io/" target="_blank">reference</a>/<a href="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks" target="_blank">repository</a>).</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks">Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos. Gitleaks is an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution for detecting secrets, past or present, in your code.</blockquote>
            <p>Gitleaks, alone, is not able to scan each commit in real time, but it supports the integration with <strong><em><a href="https://pre-commit.com/" target="_blank">pre-commit</a></em></strong> hooks.</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit - A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.</blockquote>
            <p>With pre-commit hooks, secrets will be detected before the effective commit, preventing the leak at the beginning. The integration is straightforward and it is well described by <a href="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#pre-commit" target="_blank">Gitleaks documentation</a>.</p>
            <p>You would probably need some custom rules to detect custom secrets. An example of <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> configuration file using a custom rules file (<code>custom-config.toml</code>) is the following.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-yaml">
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.18.0
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
        args: ['-c', './custom-config.toml']
            </code></pre>
            <p>When creating custom rules files, you could like to extend default rules provided by Gitleaks. An example of <code>custom-config.toml</code> to extend default rules is the following.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-toml">
# Your custom Gitleaks configuration file.
title = "Your custom Gitleaks rules"

# Extending default rules here.
[extend]
useDefault = true


[[rules]]
# Put your custom rules here.
            </code></pre>
